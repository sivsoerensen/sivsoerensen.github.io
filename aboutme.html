      <p>
        I'm Siv — originally from a small town on the west coast of Denmark. Since 
        2016 I've been living in Copenhagen, where I studied to become an engineer at the 
        Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Fast forward eight years — a degree and a PhD 
        later — and I'm still here.
      </p>

      <p>
        I live with my boyfriend north of Copenhagen, surrounded by forest and sea, 
        where meeting my daily step count or going for a dip is easy. Nature and health mean
        a lot to me, and I try to spend time outdoors every day. I enjoy cooking (and eating!) 
        homemade meals from fresh ingredients. Vegetables and seafood are my favorites,
        and I’ve followed a predominantly pescetarian diet for many years now.

        Breakfast is my “bread and butter” (quite literally), and I love baking my own sourdough —
        or visiting one of my favorite bakeries on the weekend. Matcha and coffee are also big favorites! 
        However, I’m terrible with caffeine and hope one day to see decaf coffee become as common in 
        cafés in Northern Europe as it is in the South.

        I've always been a creative and curious person and have obsessively 
        enjoyed learning and making things; LEGOs as a kid, sewing without patterns as a teen 
        (a very frustrating process — why I do it to myself, I don’t know), knitting, drawing, and 
        more recently, writing. I think that’s why I wanted to become an engineer — to understand 
        how things work, recognize patterns, and apply that knowledge in new and creative ways.

        Reading has been both an escape and an addiction since I churned through all the
        Harry Potter books in the spring of fourth grade. Since then, I’ve always come
        back to reading, even if I’ve had to go on the occasional “detox” to stay 
        focused on studying for exams or other, much less thrilling tasks.
      </p>

        I begun my studies thinking mechanical engineering was the perfect balance
        between math and creating things, but quickly realized that math and logic were what
        I was truly passionate about — and my physics intuition (or lack thereof) wasn’t exactly helping either.
        I therefore pursued a Master’s degree in 
        Mathematical Modelling and Computation, where I focused mainly on operations research
        (optimization), algorithms, data structures, and machine learning.
      </p>

      <p class="spaced">
        Finding my niche quite late in my studies, I felt I wasn’t quite done learning yet
        and decided to continue on to a PhD in Operations Research. I had a wonderful
        supervisor and learned a lot (perhaps too much about grit and perseverance), but my
        PhD journey really confirmed for me that I’m better suited to a collaborative 
        environment — a larger team with more variety in people and ideas to bounce off.
        I also didn’t get quite the same kick out of getting a paper published as I do 
        from working on a real-world application with tangible results that make a 
        meaningful difference.
