    <div class="body">
      <p>I'm Siv&#8212;originally from a small town on the west coast of Denmark. Since 
        2016 I've been living in Copenhagen where I studied to become an Engineer at The 
        Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Fast forward eight years&#8212;a degree and a PhD 
        later&#8212;and I'm still here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy living with my boyfriend north of Copenhagen surrounded by forest and the sea, 
        where meeting my daily step count or going for a dip is easy. Nature and health means
        a lot to me and I try to spend some time outdoors every day and enjoy cooking (and eating!) 
        homemade meals from fresh ingredients. Vegetables and seafood are my favorites
        and I have enjoyed a predominantly pescetarian diet for many years now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breakfast is my 'bread and butter' (quite literally) and I love baking my own sourdough&#8212;
        or visit one of my favorite bakeries on the weekend. Matcha and Coffee are also big favorites! I am
        however very bad with caffeine and hope one day to see decaf coffee being as common in cafes in
        northen Europe as it is in the south.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been a very creative and curious person and I've always obsessively
        enjoyed learning and making things; LEGOs as a kid, sewing without patterns as a teen
        (very frustrating process, why I do it to myself I don't know), knitting, drawing, and 
        as of recently writing. I think that's why I wanted to become an engineer&#8212;to be 
        able to understand how things work, recoginze patterns and apply that knowledge in new
        and creative ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading has been an escape and addiction of mine since I churned through all of the
        Harry Potter books in the the spring of fourth grade. Since then I've always come
        back to reading even though I at times have had to force myself on a detox to stay 
        focused on studying for exams or other much less thrilling tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my career thinking that Mechanical Engineering was the perfect balance
        between math and creating things, but quickly realized that math and logic is what
        I am actually passionate about&#8212;also my Physics inituion (or rather 
        lack thereof) is simply not helping. I therefore purused a Master's degree in 
        Mathematical Computation and Modelling where I focused mainly on Operations Research
        (optimization), algorithms, data structures, and ML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding my 'niche' quite late in my studies I felt that I wasn't quite done learning yet
        and decided to continue on to a PhD in Operations Research.
